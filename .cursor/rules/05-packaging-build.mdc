- Accept ZIP (up to configured size); compute SHA256; store in `data/blobs/`.
- Choose base runtime by `Runtime` (e.g., nodejs18.x, python3.11, rust).
- Build image:
  - `Dockerfile` template copies handler to `/var/task` (`LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT`)
  - Install deps (language-specific)
  - Set ENTRYPOINT to the runtime shim (RIC client)
- Tag image: `lambda-home/{function}:{sha256}`
- Cache by (runtime, sha256, env_hash) to avoid rebuilds.
